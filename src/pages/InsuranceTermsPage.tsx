            </Block>

            <Block title="2. What Is Covered">
              <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 text-slate-600 text-sm mt-1">

                <li>Damage caused by inadequate or inappropriate packaging by the sender</li>
                <li>Inherent vice, deterioration, or perishable goods</li>

            <Block title="4. Declared Value">
              You must declare the accurate commercial or replacement value of your shipment at booking. Underdeclaring value to reduce shipping costs will void your coverage. In the event of a claim, we may request proof of value (purchase receipts, invoices, or professional valuations).
            </Block>

            <Block title="5. How to File a Claim">
              <ol className="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-2 text-slate-600 text-sm mt-1">

              To maximise the chance of a successful claim, retain:
              <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 text-slate-600 text-sm mt-2">

            </Block>

            <Block title="7. Subrogation">
              Where we pay a claim, Quick Send Delivery Ltd acquires all rights of subrogation against responsible third parties. You agree to cooperate with any recovery action and to not settle independently with third parties once a claim has been approved.
            </Block>

            <Block title="8. Fraud">
              Submitting a fraudulent claim — including misrepresenting the value or condition of goods — will result in immediate account termination, forfeiture of all pending shipments, and may result in criminal prosecution.
            </Block>

            <Block title="9. Limitation of Liability">
              Our total liability for any single shipment, regardless of coverage tier purchased, shall not exceed USD $10,000. This limitation applies even if we have been advised of the possibility of greater loss.
